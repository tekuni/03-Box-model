## Setup

Again if you haven't copied the files from the previous exercise yet, let's move the profile folder from the previous exercise in the current directory of this challenge:

```bash
cp -r ../02-Fonts-and-colors/profile .
```

## Background & Objectives

Play with the box model (`margin/border/padding/width/height`) by splitting your profile information into different `<div>` tags.

Don't forget to **hard refresh** your browser (`cmd + shift + r`) to clear your browser's cache if your page doesn't seem to display your current code!

## Specs

Here is [your objective](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/03-box-model/).

- You should start with the following structure for your page

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
</div>
```

- The `<div class="container">` is here to center the page content using left & right margins to prevent it taking 100% of the window (which would be ugly).
- The `<div class="card">` is used to group information into a nice white box.
- Add cool touches to your cards using CSS properties like `background`, `border`, `border-radius` and `box-shadow`. Keep it simple, with white background and subtle radius and shadows (as you saw in the lecture).

## Further suggestions & resources

Here is the div centering technique for the main container:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;   /* This sets the width */
  margin: 0 auto; /* This automatically sets left/right margins */
}
```

From this exercise onwards, **it is critical that you use your developer tool (`inspect`)** to play with your CSS in the browser and test things out before you write the final code.

## Make it responsive with media queries

If you want a responsive design, you can add media queries in CSS. They work a bit like an `if` statement in ruby. Basically **you can define CSS rules that will only apply if the window is smaller than a given width**. For instance, if you want a responsive container, you can build it like this:


```css
@media (max-width: 960px) {
  /* For a screen < 960px, this CSS will be read */
  .container {
    width: 700px;
  }
}
@media (max-width: 720px) {
  /* For a screen < 720px, this CSS will be read */
  .container {
    width: 500px;
  }
}
@media (max-width: 540px) {
  /* For a screen < 540px, this CSS will be read */
  .container {
    width: 300px;
  }
}
```

Try to resize your window to understand how media queries work.

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Be careful with the order of your media queries ⚠️⚠️⚠️

As with `if` statements in ruby, order matters! If several conditions are `true`, the last CSS rule will be applied.

## Finished?

Once you've finished you can push this exercise and copy the content to the next exercise folder with this command:

```bash
# Push to Gihtub
git add .
git commit -m "Added div to my profile page"
git push origin master

# Copy folder into next exercise folder
cp -r profile ../04-Advanced-selectors
```
